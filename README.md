Project
Hospital Management System
Overview
The Hospital Management System is a Python-based application designed to simplify the management of patient records, staff schedules, and hospital resources. Featuring a fully functional Graphical User Interface (GUI), this system provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for end-users, streamlining day-to-day operations in a healthcare environment.

Features:

-Core Functionality
Patient Record Management:
Add, view, update, and delete patient information.
Appointment Scheduling:
Manage doctor and staff schedules efficiently.
Data Persistence:
Save and retrieve records using structured data storage, ensuring data is retained across sessions.

-User Interface
Fully functional GUI built with Python's Tkinter library.
Clean and responsive layout, designed for accessibility and ease of use.

-Back-End
Uses Python's core data structures, such as:
Lists and Dictionaries for managing in-memory data.
File Handling to ensure data persistence.
Optimized for performance with algorithms to manage large datasets efficiently.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
GUI Framework: Tkinter
Data Structures: Lists, Dictionaries
File I/O: CSV/Text files for storing records
Version Control: Git

How It Works:

1. Launch the Application:
Run the main Python script to start the GUI.
2. Interact with the GUI:
Use buttons, forms, and tables to interact with the system.
3. Manage Data:
Add or update patient records via the GUI, with changes reflected in the stored files.
4. Save and Retrieve Data:
Data is saved to external files to ensure persistence between sessions.

Project Highlights
This project showcases:

1. Software Design:
Separation of concerns between the GUI, data management, and file storage.
2. Data Structures:
Efficient use of Python data structures to store, search, and manipulate hospital data.
3. Problem-Solving Skills:
Implemented features to address real-world challenges in hospital management, such as data consistency and scalability.
4. GUI Development:
Designed and implemented a responsive interface that simplifies user interactions.
